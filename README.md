# 🎨 Tomodachi Musume Ng

An anime-style virtual pet game built with **Angular 22** and optional **Electron** desktop packaging. Care for **Eleanora** in her barracks room — talk, equip outfits, feed her, send her on missions, craft gear, and trade at the market. Game state persists to `localStorage` in the browser or SQLite when running as a desktop app.

## ✨ Features

* **Layered Character System**: Eleanora's appearance is dynamically rendered using a layer system, allowing seamless equipment and expression changes.
* **Dynamic Reactions**: Eleanora reacts to clicks with different expressions and dialogue based on her current affinity level.
* **Persistent Data**: Game state (player name, stats, inventory, equipment) auto-saves to `localStorage` or Electron SQLite.
* **i18n Support**: Spanish and English via `LocalizationService` and `UI_STRINGS`; language selectable on the title screen and in options.
* **Core Stats System**:
  * **Affinity** — influenced by dialogues and actions; unlocks equipment and interactions.
  * **Energy** — consumed by missions; passively regenerates over time.
  * **Satiety** — decreases over time; restored by feeding.
* **Main Actions**:
  * 🗣️ **Talk** — dynamic conversations with affinity-based nicknames.
  * 👕 **Equip** — slots for `top`, `bottom`, `suit`, `head`, `weapon`, and more.
  * 🤝 **Interact** — feed Eleanora to restore energy and manage satiety.
  * ⚔️ **Mission** — send Eleanora on missions; success and loot depend on equipped gear.
  * 🛠️ **Crafting** — combine materials to create new items.
  * 🛒 **Market** — buy and sell items, materials, and recipes.
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first HUD with a bottom action dock; desktop layout uses a grid shell with a vertical sidebar.
* **Pure CSS styling**: No Tailwind — all UI uses design tokens and component styles in `src/styles.css` and co-located `*.component.css` files.
